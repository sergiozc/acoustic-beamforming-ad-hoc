# Scope
The aim of this project is to go one step further in the subject of "speech enhancement" using an Ad-Hoc array of smartphones.

An alternative synchronization method has been proposed, 
studied in an ad-hoc array of smartphones, with the purpose of being able 
to correctly implement a beamformer and finally obtain the experimental 
directivity pattern resulting from the array.

# App
An Android App, which 
will play the role of a client on each smartphone, has been created and it can be found at "App/" directory.

# Server
The specifications of the server created, which will achieve a strong communications with the corresponding smartphones, can be found at "BeamServer/" directory.

# Synchronization
Two different synchronization methods have been proposed. Both can be found at "SINCRONIZACIÓN/Métodos_Sincronización/" directory.
One of them consists in the use of timestamps from the server and the other consists in the use of "autochirps" for each smartphone.

# Beamforming
In order to achieve a better signal quality, an acoustic Delay and Sum Beamforming (DAS) is proposed. It has been implemented in Python and it can be found at "Beamforming/" directory.

# Documentation
Further information can be found at "Informe.pdf" file, where all the details are contained.
